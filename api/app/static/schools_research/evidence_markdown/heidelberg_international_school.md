- #### Habitat for Humanity
H.I.S. also supports ‘Habitat for Humanity’. In 2018 the first group of 9 Grade 11 CAS students travelled to Warsaw, Poland to assist in the building of much needed housing. The students found a number of ways to raise money to cover some costs of their visit and brought back a wealth of experiences to share with the community. Further trips are planned to develop this relationship.
