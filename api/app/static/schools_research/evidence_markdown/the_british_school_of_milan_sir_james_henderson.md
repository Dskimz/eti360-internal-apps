- # Educational Trips and Visits
Experiential learning is at the heart of our approach at BSM. As such, a range of educational visits supplement and further enrich the teaching and co-curricular activities that take place.

- Opportunities to take part in activities away from the familiar environments of home and school can challenge students to be independent as well as to develop their skills of enquiry, thought and communication.
