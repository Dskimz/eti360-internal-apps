- # Lunch Service
Our students have two food breaks in the school day, morning snack and lunch. At the School Campus each student may bring healthy snacks and lunch to school. The cafeteria is open for lunch at 13:00 for secondary school students (Grades 6-12). Off-campus privileges are granted to students in Grades 11 and 12. These students are allowed to leave the school at lunch break.
