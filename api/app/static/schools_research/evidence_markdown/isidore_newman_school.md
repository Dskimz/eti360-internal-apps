- Sixth through eighth graders participate two to three times per week in Enrichment classes. The nature of the classes varies, but the topic of every lesson is a valuable one that does not fit squarely within the traditional academic curriculum. In Enrichment, members of the administrative team, the Student Support Team, and the faculty facilitate lessons centered on health and wellness, academic support, and other topics or skills such as financial literacy, digital citizenship, and even keyboarding or letter writi
- **Field Trips and Overnights**
The Newman Middle School offers a rich and varied palette of field trips and overnight excursions, some of which are yearly events, others of which vary from year to year. Each fall both the seventh and eighth grades go on extended overnight trips – the seventh grade to Percy Quin State Park in Mississippi for three days and the eighth grade to Camp Kahdalea in North Carolina for eight days. Both trips are built around team building and leadership development.
- Besides day trips that are unique to particular courses, whole grades and combinations of grades participate in day trips to New Orleans Museum of Art, the National World War II Museum, the New Canal Lighthouse, Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve, Fontainebleau State Park, and Bayou St. John.

- **Freshman Washington Trip**
For over 60 years the Newman freshmen class has travelled annually to Washington, D.C. This one-week experience is meant to coincide with the 9th grade GES (government and economic systems) curriculum. While in D.C., the class visits the many well-known memorials and museums, takes a class picture in front of the Capitol (before a tour), and the class officers lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington Cemetery.
- The trip also includes day trips to Monticello, the University of Virginia, Jamestown, Williamsburg, Mount Vernon, the National Cathedral, and the United States Naval Academy.
