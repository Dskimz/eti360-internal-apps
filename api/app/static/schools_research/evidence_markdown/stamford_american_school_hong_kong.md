- We offer a convenient shuttle bus from Ho Man Tin and Yau Ma Tei station to encourage independence and sustainable transport for secondary students who take public transportation.
Our bus routes and times are designed to keep travel time minimum. Students arrive at Stamford before classes begin to avoid morning rush hour traffic. Upon arrival, all students are supervised and have opportunities to play, read and do other activities before the school day.

Stamford is a place of work and study and therefore appropriate dress is neat, clean, modest and in good repair.
All students are expected to wear full school uniform at all times including on field trips and on the school buses. Please ensure that all items belonging to your child are clearly labeled with your child’s name
- Exchange of items is allowed once within two (2) weeks of the purchase date. Items must be in original packaging and accompanied by the original invoice. Purchased items are non-refundable.
