    "trip_overview_narrative": "YCIS Shanghai offers a range of educational trips and excursions integrated into the curriculum across grade levels. Primary students (Years 1-3) take field trips around Shanghai to cultural sites, parks, museums, and farms to use their Chinese language skills. Upper Primary students (Years 5-6) participate in educational trips and overnight camps to develop independence and collaboration. Middle School students (Years 7-9) engage in the Education Outside of the Classroom (EOTC) program, traveling to key cultural regions in China such as Xi'an, Shandong, and Fujian. High School students (Years 10-11) undertake educational and service trips within China, including visits to rural primary schools supported by the school's charity program for service and volunteer work.",
