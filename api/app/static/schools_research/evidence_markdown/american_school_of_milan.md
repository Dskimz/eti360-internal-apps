- ## Field Trips
Each October, ASM students embark on thoughtfully curated field trips that blend learning and adventure. These experiences bring classroom lessons to life while strengthening friendships and teamwork. From the historic cities of Italy to the cultural landscapes of Europe, our field trips allow students to explore new environments, connect with their peers and teachers, and return with lasting memories and a deeper sense of belonging.
It’s more than just travel; it’s experiential learning in action.
