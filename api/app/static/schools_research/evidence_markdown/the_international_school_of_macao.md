- Experience Week helps students on their journey to becoming informed, purposeful and active global citizens. This In addition to the educational benefits of Experience Week, students obtain key insights into themselves and learn the importance of co-existing with others. Experience Week encourages our students to reflect on the world and how they can make a difference.
Experience Week is an expectation for all secondary students, framed by CAS (Creativity, Activity, Service) and geared toward educational outcomes. 
- ## Family Service Trips
Each year, TIS offers families the chance to travel together to another country, with service to others at the heart of the trip. These week-long adventures allow families to experience other cultures and truly immerse themselves in a totally different way of life.
Our partner organization, World Volunteer, arranges home-stays for our families in the remote villages we visit. Through these homestays, we truly get to experience what life is like in someone else’s shoes.
