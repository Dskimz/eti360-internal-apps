## Trips and Expeditions
Stepping out of your comfort zone and normal living environment on field trips, expeditions, and retreats enhance and complement our students’ studies. These activities build resilience and adaptability, and provide opportunities for our students to reflect on themselves, their goals, and their community. ASB actively pursues as many opportunities as we can for our students to experience adventure both in India and abroad.
