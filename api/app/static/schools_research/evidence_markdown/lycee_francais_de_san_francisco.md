Students emerge from these programs with superior speaking skills, new-found confidence and knowledge.
Each educational trip brings learning to life, inspiring the next adventure. Each destination brings a new and diffe
- Each educational trip brings learning to life, inspiring the next adventure. Each destination brings a new and different focus that aligns with the curriculum for that grade: History & Geography, Science & Technology, Languages & Culture, Sports or Service Learning.

Traveling and being away from home creates opportunities for students to be confronted with new experiences and challenges they will overcome together with their peers and teachers. They develop the ability to solve practical life challenges even in unfamiliar contexts. Their experiences and newly acquired knowledge will provide them with perspective and confidence making it easier to gain the respect of others.
**Better academic performance**
- New settings and temporary distance from home are great incubators for thought. New experiences will challenge preconceived ideas and invite students to open their minds.
Travel provides experiences that will likely help develop personality, sense of purpose, values and priorities. Discovering a new place is also a chance to discover one’s self.
**Growth & Independence**
- **Growth & Independence**
Through the Global Learning program, students have opportunities to see what they are capable of accomplishing by themselves. Traveling allows students to develop themselves in ways that can only be achieved by venturing outside of their comfort zone.
