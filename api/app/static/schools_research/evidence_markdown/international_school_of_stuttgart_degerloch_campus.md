- In small classes, with strong pastoral care and personal guidance, children are known, supported, and encouraged every day. Learning extends beyond the classroom; through play, daily trips to nearby athletic centres, and excursions that help students understand the world around them. Older students serve as role models, strengthening the warmth and connection that define our community.
