- ### Term 3 - Journeys
With the arrival of warmer weather, Term 3 focuses on journeys that include an overnight camping element. These expeditions might take place on foot, by bike, or on the water using canoes, kayaks, or stand-up paddleboards. Students take ownership of their experience by planning meals, purchasing food, and cooking under supervision. This not only builds practical outdoor skills but also fosters self-confidence, independence, and strong interpersonal connections.
