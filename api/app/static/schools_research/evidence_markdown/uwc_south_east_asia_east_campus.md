- The logistical challenges of maintaining an effective Outdoor Education programme during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the necessity of initiating local Singapore trips, have coincided with UWCSEA’s increased focus on deeply understanding and mitigating of the ecological consequences of travelling far and wide to experience the outdoors.
