Raider girls soccer advanced to the district championship in emphatic fashion, riding a sensational four-goal performance from senior Stella Colombo ’26. Colombo set the tone early, opening the scoring with a brilliant strike from just outside the 18-yard box, and the Raiders never looked back. Sophomores Andy Lamar '28 and Reese Almazan '28, along with 8th grader Evie Clement, each contributed an assist in a balanced team effort. Freshman goalkeeper Marina Molina '29 anchored the defense and earned the s

- Clubs are so important at Ransom Everglades that they are woven into the school day at the middle school. At the upper school, clubs meet before, during and after school hours. Through their participation in service clubs, academic teams, honor societies and school government, students make a difference on and off campus.
- #### Everglades Experience
For more than 30 years, freshmen at Ransom Everglades have journeyed into the Ten Thousand Islands in the Everglades for a five-day, four-night adventure that helps them bond as a class while learning useful life skills. Students leave their smartphones behind, traveling by canoe, cooking their own meals and spending nights in tents. They forever remember this special time as a class.

- #### Associate Director of College Counseling
I am thrilled to serve the Ransom Everglades community as a college counselor! Before coming to RE, I spent seven years in college admissions at Princeton, Stanford and Yale University. My experience as an admission officer gave me a deep understanding of the highly selective admissions process, but more importantly, it reinforced my appreciation for the individuality, potential and resilience of every student. I view the college process as a journey, and while the dest

At Ransom Everglades, I teach upper school English and serve as a writing specialist for the college counseling office. I lived and worked in New England and New York for over a decade, but the sunshine state is a familiar place: I grew up in Tallahassee and earned my BA from the University of Florida. Most recently, I was an editor for a Manhattan-based advertising agency and taught literature courses in the evenings at Fairfield University; before that, I taught English 
- #### Associate Director of College Counseling
I am excited to work at Ransom Everglades as an Associate Director of College Counseling. Prior to my arrival at RE, I worked at two different liberal arts institutions (Kenyon College and Wesley College) where I had the opportunity to interact with students and their families during the college application and admissions process. Moving to this side of the desk aligned with my BA in psychology from Widener University and my MEd in Elementary and Secondary School Counse
