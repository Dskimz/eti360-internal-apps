- ### Community, Identity, Relationships, and Belonging
To build a strong and supportive community, the entire Middle School engages in off-campus experiences to help students strengthen relationships, build their identities, and develop a sense of belonging — all important aspects of our Middle School program.
We offer a wide range of inclusive activities designed to encourage student involvement in school life and foster personal responsibility.

> I really enjoyed my time in Studio, and I really think people should join. The community I built in it was really nice. Another thing I love about Studio is that the curriculum is a lot more hands-on, so we get more field trips and cool activities.
