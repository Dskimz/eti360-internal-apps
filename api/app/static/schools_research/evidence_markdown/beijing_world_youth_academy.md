- EXHIBITIONS
To demonstrate the value of our clubs, there will be a club exhibition at the end of each club season. Clubs will be required to show their progress through assessment tasks. This may be something they have made or designed, performances, videos, posters, field trip reflections, or other creative ways of demonstrating progress and learning. Parents and peers will be invited to the exhibition to get an idea of what other clubs provide.
