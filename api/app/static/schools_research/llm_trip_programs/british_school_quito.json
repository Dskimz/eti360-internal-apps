    "trip_overview_narrative": "The British School Quito leverages its location in one of the most beautiful areas of Ecuador to organize off-site learning activities and school trips, which are considered a valuable part of the student experience. Parents must give permission for all outings, and some trips may incur a small cost. Additionally, the school offers the Duke of Edinburgh Award program starting in Year 10, which includes structured training and expedition preparation.",
