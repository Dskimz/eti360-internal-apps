- #### spring term // impacting the world for christ
**Spring Term is a cornerstone of the North Cobb Christian School experience for students in 7th through 12th grade.** It’s a powerful time of spiritual growth, service, and perspective-shifting experiences. Whether serving locally or traveling abroad, students return changed — with a deeper faith, stronger friendships, and a clearer sense of purpose in Christ.
