- Our Co-Teachers also aid in furthering students' language development by providing additional vocabulary and conversation in both English and Chinese throughout the school day.
At YCIS, we see language as a tool to access culture, and for the students in Years 1-3, their education extends beyond the classroom to integrate their learning and use their Chinese language skills on field trips around Shanghai.
- #### Educational Trips and Excursions
Throughout the school year, our students take trips and excursions as an extension of their learning. From large Shanghai parks to museums, and Chinese cultural sites to farms, these field trips are integrated into the broader YCIS curriculum. Students are encouraged to reflect on their experiences with their Co-Teachers once they return to their classrooms.
