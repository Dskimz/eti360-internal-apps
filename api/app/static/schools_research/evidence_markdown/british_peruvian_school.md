- Your child will become proficient in English and Spanish whilst also reaching an efficient command of everyday French. Our school curriculum prepares all our students for the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma, allowing them to be accepted to top universities in Peru and abroad.
Our Secondary students are taught Global Politics and Citizenship, Religion and Ethics, and Business Management, so that they have a broader perspective of an increasingly globalised and rapidly changing world.
- Outstanding learning experiences
Our rich extra-curricular programme provides opportunities for students to develop other talents, such as practising a variety of sports, debating, or performing music, drama, or dance. Our students also have incredible experiences on field trips to Peru's exciting landscapes or to international destinations.

- We also encourage global awareness through discussions linked to a wide range of world literature, organised around themes of diversity, culture, and inclusion. These themes unfold into trips that widen our students’ understanding of the world around them as they travel throughout the three geographical regions of Peru. They also go on international trips to England and to Nord Anglia Education’s international sports competition, the Global Games.
