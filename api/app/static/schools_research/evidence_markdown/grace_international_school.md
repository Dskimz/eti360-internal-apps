- ## SPIRITUAL LIFE
It is our mission to enable not just academic growth in our students but also spiritual growth. The GIS Spiritual Life Department exists to cultivate students with Christ-like character and values, and to challenge them to transform their generation. Student faiths are fostered through chapels, Elevation Week, Ministry Days, and other focused activities on and off campus.

“I love being a student at GIS because I have so many opportunities to get involved in all kinds of activities such as traveling to other places to compete in sports, playing in school concerts for Honors Jazz Band, serving on StuCo and other clubs.”
Dianrui W. (12th grade)GIS Student
- Camille T. (Class of 2012)GIS Student
“I’m so thankful for GIS implementing Jesus’ teaching of helping those in need as a necessity of being a Christian. Now, traveling to isolated places to spend time with people and use my blessings to bless them is second nature as it should be.”
Bethany C. (Class of 2013)GIS Student

“When you are living abroad with a kid who has disabilities, you usually think of what you don’t have and trick yourself into thinking that things would be better if you went home. But our reality is that our daughter gets so much more at Grace than she would have gotten in the United States.”
