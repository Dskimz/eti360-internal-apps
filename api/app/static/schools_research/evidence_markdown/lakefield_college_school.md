- ## Outdoor Adventure
LCS also offers opportunities for students to participate in outdoor adventure expeditions that take place in a variety of settings ranging from nearby rivers, lakes and woods, to Algonquin Park, and through the expedition program, to the Northwest Territories and international destinations.
- The [expedition program](http://www.lcs.on.ca/page/Beyond-the-Class/Global-Learning/Expeditions) is assessed on a yearly basis by students and faculty to help maintain the high standards set by the school and to keep the program current.
- Supporters of the school who believe in the school's philosophy and commitment to outdoor education and outdoor adventure opportunities sponsor some of these expeditions.
