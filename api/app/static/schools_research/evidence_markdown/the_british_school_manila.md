* Activities Week & Trips
- # Activities Week & Trips
**The British School Manila’s residential and outdoor education programme is central to the learning experience of our students. It provides them with personal challenge and develops their well-being by helping them grow as individuals.**
- #### **Senior School**
From Year 7 to 10 students participate in Activities Week, choosing from an extensive range of week-long residential trips, which are physically demanding and allow our students to get hands-on with community service.
Our trips also encourage students to be reflective on their own personal journeys and focus on developing their own well-being as well as those around them.
