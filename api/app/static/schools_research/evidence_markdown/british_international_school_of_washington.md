- Inspiration in the District
Here in the nation's capital, we have world-class museums, historical monuments, and national parks at our doorstep. We take field trips that complement and support in-class lessons and ensure students benefit from our proximity to DC's impressive sites.
Service Trips
- Fostering Growth while Helping Others
BISW students take a hands-on approach to service and community support. Local service trips to DC-area charitable organizations help students see the positive impact of their actions right here in Washington, DC. Similarly, service trips abroad help BISW students connect with and aid international communities. These experiences challenge our students to discover their social purpose and global citizenship.
