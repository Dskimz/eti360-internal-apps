- Together with our fantastic and dedicated team of parent volunteers, we organise a range of initiatives, such as social events, classes and workshops, volunteering opportunities, and communications that keep us connected both on and off campus throughout the year. You’ll hear from us regularly, and we warmly encourage you to get involved and create lasting memories that strengthen the spirit of our school community.
Personally, as a parent at ISB, I’ve always felt a great sense of community that is truly special, d
- ### Former ISB Parent
My family and I were part of ISB for three years, during which my children, Jenami and Nirek grew into independent thinkers, made wonderful friends, and embraced opportunities like international field trips and using their own MacBooks. For me ISB was just as rewarding, offering a warm, receptive community where I’ve contributed as an ISB DI STEM pioneer, ISBPlus Technology stimulator, and as the ES FA representative.
- **How would you summarise your overall experience at ISB in a few sentences?**

From my time there, the sports and the

The trip we took in 8th Grade to Normandy. I hated history and anything to do with it prior to that. Since then, I started watching documentaries for fun and later decided to become a history teacher myself. These experiences are very rare. For example, schools in the U.S. only get to go on one-day field trips to museums about WWII, whereas at ISB, we went to Pointe du Hoc, and I stood inside of a bunker. That was incredible!
