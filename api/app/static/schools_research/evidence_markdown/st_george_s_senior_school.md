- ADST courses focus on learning experiences that challenge students to use the Design Thinking process to tackle real-world problems and create workable solutions. Students engage in frequent simulations — including case studies or events like the annual Dragons' Lair — and make strong connections to community partners through mentors, guest speakers, and field trips.
