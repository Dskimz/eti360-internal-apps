- **We are fortunate to be situated in one of the most beautiful areas of Ecuador.**
We aim to take advantage of our location by arranging learning activities off site as we believe that school trips are a valuable part of a student's school experience. Parents will be required to give permission for all outings. Some field trips may incur a small charge but we endeavour to keep all costs to a minimum. All trips are risk assessed in advance and signed off through a thorough process.

- **Tenemos la suerte de estar ubicados en una de las zonas más bellas del Ecuador.**
Nuestro objetivo es aprovechar nuestra ubicación organizando actividades de aprendizaje fuera del sitio, ya que creemos que los viajes escolares son una parte valiosa de la experiencia escolar de un estudiante. Los padres deberán dar permiso para todas las salidas. Algunas excursiones pueden incurrir en un pequeño cargo, pero nos esforzamos por mantener todos los costos al mínimo.
