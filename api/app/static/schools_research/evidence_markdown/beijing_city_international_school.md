- ## [Week Without Walls](javascript:;)
Week Without Walls (WWW) is a very special feature in the BCIS calendar. Each year, students from the Elementary and Secondary Schools take part in various activities and trips off campus to directly experience the culture and environment of our host country, China. WWW is a full week dedicated to allowing our students to not only see more of our host country, but also feel it, taste it, and truly experience it in every respect.

- ## Off-Campus Health Service
If a student becomes ill in school, he/she will be sent to the School Nurse who will then decide if the child needs to be sent home or to be sent to a hospital. School Nurse will notify the respective principal and parents or the designated emergency contact person of student’s illness or injury. In the event of an extreme emergency or a life-threatening situation, the child will be taken to a hospital immediately for further consultation and treatment. Please see the following rules:
- * When a child displays a fever of 37.3℃/99.1oF, the parents will be notified and will be requested to collect the child from school. The School Nurse will request that the child is kept at home 48 hours after the symptoms have past, so as to ensure rest and complete recovery and to minimize risk of exposure to other students.
* If the child needs off-campus health service, School Nurse will contact parents or their designated emergency contact person to confirm which health care facility they would like us to take
