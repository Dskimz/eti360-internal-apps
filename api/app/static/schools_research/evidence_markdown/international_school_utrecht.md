- A typical day in Kindergarten, primary and secondary.
Our Kindergarten, primary and secondary students will take you through their day. They will tell you about lessons, excursions, after school activities and celebrations.
- Primary
Primary students can be dropped off in the Aula from 8:00 where they will be supervised until it is time to go to their classroom at 8:20. If families arrive at 8:20 children independently go to their classroom for the start of the first lesson at 8:30. Besides spending time with their classroom teacher(s) primary students have specialist teachers for Dutch Language Acquisition, visual arts, drama, music, computational thinking and PHE. Primary students have a snack break in the morning when they go outside
- Secondary
Secondary students often travel to school by bike. Students who come from further afield might use public transport (train/tram/bus) to get to school. Secondary students have lessons according to their timetable. They might also have lesson free periods during the day, which are meant for self study. Students often bring their own packed lunch, which they might heat up at school. Students can also order a salad or sandwich from an external catering company which is set up in the school.
