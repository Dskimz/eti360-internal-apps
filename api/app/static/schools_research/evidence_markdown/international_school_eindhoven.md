- Primary students get library, PHE, ICT, DFL or EFL and technology lessons from specialist teachers besides their regular curriculum with their classroom teachers. All our primary students get a morning outside snack & play break and a free outside playtime after eating their lunch in their classrooms.
Every year, students from group 6 get a chance to go on an overnight trip. Primary lessons end on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Fridays at 15:30, and Wednesdays at 12:30.
### Secondary

- **Bottle Initiative**
The “Bottle Initiative” was introduced by our student council to collect the refundable (statiegeld) bottles and exchange them for money. This way we encourage recycling, and keep our oceans, rivers, beaches clean, and help fundraising for a charity called Mary’s Meals. This charity provides meals to poor children in other countries.
