- Boarding at Westminster has many benefits. It allows pupils to take full advantage of the School’s extensive evening programme of concerts, plays, sport and lectures, and also gives boarders the opportunity to take part in many external academic and cultural pursuits in the evenings and at weekends. The School’s location right in the centre of London offers pupils access to an unmatched choice of restaurants, shops, cinemas, galleries, theatres and so much more. All this variety right on our doorstep means boarders
- All boarders in the Lower School, up to the age of 16, go home every weekend. Some Sixth Form boarders stay at School at weekends, but the School is typically quiet on Saturday nights.
* Can I board at Westminster if my parents live abroad? →
Westminster is not a suitable boarding school for pupils below the age of 16 whose parents live overseas. We do welcome overseas boarders in the Sixth Form, but they must have guardians with whom they can stay at ‘Exeat Weekends’ or when they are unwell.

- Westminster offers an extensive variety of both cultural and leisure trips and in an average year the school mounts approximately 60 expeditions. Linguists are well catered for by visits to France, Spain, Germany, Russia and Cuba; art historians have visited Florence and Venice to study the works of the Old Masters; skiers have experienced the slopes in the French Alps, Jasper and Vermont; rowers have taken part in the Head of the Charles Regatta in Boston; and geographers have appreciated the landscapes of Morocco
- ##### Expeditions
Some of the School’s expeditions have been running for many years now, such as the longstanding Greek trip for Classics enthusiasts, which takes place at Easter. Each year, Year 12 pupils are offered the chance to travel to the States to scout out US university options. Twice a year, the School runs Lower School Expeditions (LSEs), for pupils in Years 9, 10 and 11. Recent LSEs have involved travel the UK and Europe, offering pupils the opportunity to photograph the Northern Lights in Iceland and t

- We also make the most of our own nation’s beauty, history and heritage with excursions to a number of locations within the UK. In particular we are very fortunate to have School House in Alston, Cumbria, which serves as a base for a number of outdoor activity trips across the northern Pennines. All Year 9 boys visit Alston for a four-day stay in house groups, together with their housemaster and another member of house staff, as a way of building community. In addition to exploring the fells of the Lake District and
- ##### Exchanges
There is no better way to learn a language than to immerse yourself in the culture where it is spoken. Over the years that Westminster has offered an exchange of pupils with schools in France, Spain, Germany, Chile and China we have not only seen new friendships formed and greater cultural awareness gained but also a higher standard of examination results.

- By visiting the native home of the language they are learning, and by engaging in genuine conversation with peers who speak it as a mother tongue, pupils are able to learn the colloquial and cultural nuances of a language in a very different way than they can in the classroom. Our European exchanges with schools in Berlin, Paris and Riga are open pupils in Year 11, and allow language-learners to spend one week with a host family overseas, and similarly host their exchange partner for one week in London (indeed in B
