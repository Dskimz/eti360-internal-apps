- HANDS-ON SERVICE IN TANZANIA
Our High Schoolers can go on our annual international service expedition to Arusha, Tanzania. Alongside peers from other Nord Anglia schools, our students deepen their global citizenship when they get to know Arusha’s people, culture, and environment through hands-on service.
