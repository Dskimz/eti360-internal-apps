- ### English and German Languages
English and German languages are used throughout the day to support learning. Excursions into our local community provide children with opportunities to use the German language connected to their learning at school. We also help and encourage students to maintain and develop their mother tongue, as this is important for their cultural identity and cognitive development. We recognise that having home language skills also helps students in learning additional languages.
