BSJ students benefit from exceptional learning opportunities beyond the classroom, including the IB Environmental Systems and Societies field trip to Tioman Island, Malaysia. Recently, our Year 12 students spent five days exploring this biodiversity hotspot, honing their ecological sampling skills across a wide range of ecosystems, from rivers and primary rainforests to intertidal zones, mangroves, and coral reefs.

Stepping far beyond the classroom, our Year 6 students are exploring the wonders of nature while developing resilience, independence, and a true sense of responsibility. This residential trip helps them build confidence, strengthen friendships, and discover the joy of learning in new and meaningful ways.
- Their residential trip to Sukabumi was more than just a change of scenery, it was an opportunity to challenge themselves, develop leadership, and strengthen their sense of community.
- Last week, our Year 10 students returned from a remarkable residential trip to Bandung, an experience filled with adventure, connection, and personal growth. From rainforest hikes to off-road jeep rides, many took on new challenges with courage and enthusiasm. It was a joy to see students step outside their comfort zones, build new friendships, and embrace the beauty of nature, away from the usual distractions.

The Year 9 residential trip has been an incredible journey of personal growth. Away from the classroom and digital distractions, our students embraced challenges in nature, explored Indonesian culture, and built stronger bonds with their peers. These experiences have helped shape greater resilience, self-awareness, and independence — qualities that will support them both in and beyond school life.
