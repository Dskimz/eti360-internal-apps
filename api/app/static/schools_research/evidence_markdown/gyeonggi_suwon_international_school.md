- Our annual retreats are some of the most anticipated events for our students.
High School students are taken off campus for the weekend while Middle school students have their retreat on campus.
This is an opportunity for teachers to connect with our students on a better level. The weekend retreat helps students gain perspective for their lives and time at GSIS.
- ### **Vision and Purpose:**
Each year God continues to move in ways far beyond our expectations at GSIS as we travel to serve other countries. We are confident that God has led you to be a part of this program for His glory,and for the benefit of others. Please take a moment to read through our vision statement:
“It is at the core of our school identity to train and equip students to be a blessing to those who are in need. One way this is possible is through the VASE Program. It is our desire that GSIS builds fruit
- “It is at the core of our school identity to train and equip students to be a blessing to those who are in need. One way this is possible is through the VASE Program. It is our desire that GSIS builds fruitful and lasting relationships with workers in other nations to support the work God has given them to do.”
Currently our VASE trips travel throughout various locations in South East Asia. For details on exact locations please contact the Student Ministry Office.
