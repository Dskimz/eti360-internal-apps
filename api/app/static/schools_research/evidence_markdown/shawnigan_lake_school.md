Our youngest students have been getting to know Vancouver Island in their first months at Shawnigan thanks to some off-campus excursions with our Outdoor Education teachers, part of our [OuterEDGE](https://www.shawnigan.ca/programs/experiential-learning) experiential learning programs aimed at Grade 8s and 9s.
In mid-September, the Grade 8s hiked through campus, and kayaked and canoed on Shawnigan Lake, and last week, the group hiked Maple Mountain near Duncan, exploring the fall colours and the way the e

- Spanish 12 students capped off a chapter about recipes by preparing several food items from Spain and Latin America in a special event hosted by Señora Andrea Carballo last Friday.
After studying several recipes from Spanish-speaking countries, the students chose four to make, then used their lunch break and Spanish class period to travel to Señora Carballo’s home off campus to create the foods.
The selections included pupusas, a Salvadoran tortilla filled with beans and cheese (and meat, for the non-vegetarians);

Language is learned through the study of authentic cultural texts across a range of media forms, such as music, poetry, movies, news articles, websites and podcasts and allows language learning to retain its vibrancy. In addition to classroom activities, every opportunity to travel, to reach out, to experience and to enjoy is eagerly seized upon.

- Ski Week has been a unique and integral part of Shawnigan’s annual calendar since 1973.
Taking place in February each year, Ski Week is timed to take everyone off campus to a fresh, fun environment at a point when the usual dark, rainy West Coast winter days seem to be stretching unrelentingly on. Manning Park Resort is located in the beautiful British Columbian Cascade Range, and for the duration of Ski Week, Shawnigan takes over the whole resort, turning it into an experiential learning playground where students,
- Each EDGE project requires a great deal from every participant: pre-trip planning and fundraising, demanding travel, hard physical and emotional work, long days in hot, humid or cold weather, infrequent access to hot water for bathing and laundry, and--perhaps the greatest challenge--little or no personal space. Each trip pushes students out of their comfort zone, tests their limits and puts service and stewardship front and centre. The EDGE program connects students with parts of the world that they may have never
