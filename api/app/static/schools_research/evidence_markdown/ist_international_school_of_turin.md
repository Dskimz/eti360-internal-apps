- The School offers both trips within Italian borders that focus on **Italian heritage, regional differences, and cultural diversity** , and international field trips to focus on **cross-cultural understanding.**
We believe that curricular and extracurricular activities involving travel are an important offering to our students as a learning medium and it is expected that all students take part to the trips.
Expenses for these trips are included in the regular school tuition for the school year.
