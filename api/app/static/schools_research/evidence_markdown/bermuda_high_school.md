BHS is the only Round Square Member school in Bermuda.

The tenets of the six IDEALS (Internationalism, Democracy, Environmentalism, Adventure, Leadership, Service) root their education in an international context. Our Round Square values and philosophy shape our students into global citizens well before they leave BHS.
