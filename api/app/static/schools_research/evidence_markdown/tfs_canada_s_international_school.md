# Trips and Exchanges
## No matter where our student travellers go, their trips and exchanges will always be a journey

They may indeed visit famous sites, such as monuments, ruins, governmental buildings and palaces, but the purpose of each trip, no matter the length of days or grade of the student, is to craft an experience that will broaden their perspective, impart knowledge and engage them in the life of the community, region or country visited.
- Each trip or exchange has, as its larger goal, the intent of helping our students develop as individuals and citizens.

With passports, suitcases and dictionaries at the ready, TFS students are travelling the world. International trips have been a beloved institution at TFS for more than 40 years, awakening our students’ international perspective.
- Whether it’s a language immersion trip to Switzerland, a service project in Peru, or a classical, musical tour of Italy, students will have opportunities to hone their language skills, make lasting friendships with their peers from TFS and their hosts abroad and develop intercultural competencies and their leadership skills.

- #### France
We have the unique opportunity for individual students to take part in a reciprocal exchange program with one of our partner schools in France: Lycée Montaigne in Paris. Our ultimate goal is to be able to offer each student at TFS the opportunity to take part in an exchange at least once between Grade 6 and Level V. This special opportunity to attend another school, and become fully immersed in a different culture, has already opened doors and broadened horizons for students and families at TFS. Student
- #### Spain
In March, our Grade 10 (Level III) students will have the opportunity to spend a week in the beautiful city of Barcelona and discover what the Spanish culture has to offer. This trip is part of an exchange program with Bon Soleil, a French school from the region. The TFS community will be hosting our partner’s students in February.

- #### Switzerland
This trip offers a language immersion experience to students in Grade 7. Exchange school Institute Florimont, like TFS, follows both the French national curriculum and the International Baccalaureate programs (the IB was founded in Switzerland, in fact), which means that the students there are learning the same curriculum, but in a completely different setting. Their excursions include tours of the United Nations, the Red Cross museum, a chocolate factory and the cities of Lausanne and Geneva.
