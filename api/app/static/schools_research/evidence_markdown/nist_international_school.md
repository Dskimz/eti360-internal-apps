- Our Expeditions programme starts with our youngest students and challenges them with a self-contained overnight experience with their classmates on the school campus. With each successive year, these expeditions increase in remoteness, duration and skill level until our NIST students are planning and undertaking their own expeditions.

- At all levels, teachers play a significant role in our Expeditions programme. Our influence as educators is felt both inside and outside the classroom and students gain a tremendous amount from sharing their experiences with their teachers. There are many opportunities for interested teachers to be involved in the International Award trips and other optional expeditions with students.
