- We have extended and made our school bus system more efficient, not only for the wider area around Waterloo but especially the greater Brussels region.
We can now offer transport in comfortable 7-seater vans for our students’ journeys to and from school. This option allows to shorten each of their commutes, and positively impact our students’ travel and pick-up time. Contact us today to obtain approximate pick-up and drop-off times for more specific locations.
