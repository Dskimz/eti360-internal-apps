- For travel by road, rail or air to competitions outside of Vienna each student will pay 120% of the cost. (The extra 20% is used to help defray the trip expenses of coaches and chaperones.) At the start of the season students will be made aware of their travel commitments. If a student cannot travel he/she must note this on the contract. Parents will receive an invoice from the school via email for trips and/or tracksuits after the trip has taken place.
